We've been given an image: `3UWLBAUCb9Z2.jpg`.
Let's first check the file's details:

```zsh
$ file 3UWLBAUCb9Z2.jpg
3UWLBAUCb9Z2.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 72x72, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, big-endian, direntries=8, orientation=
upper-left, xresolution=2170, yresolution=2178, resolutionunit=2, software=Photos 1.5, datetime=2014:12:27 16:45:55], baseline, precision 8, 800x307, components 3
```

Now, since there's not much to go by, we can try and view the image in different formats like: text, hex, etc.

When trying to view it as text and searching for keywords like "flag", we get:

```zsh
$ cat 3UWLBAUCb9Z2.jpg > image_text.txt
$ grep "flag" image_text.txt --text
                <rdf:Description xmlns:MicrosoftPhoto="http://ns.microsoft.com/photo/1.0/"><MicrosoftPhoto:CameraSerialNumber>flag{EEe_x_I_FFf}</MicrosoftPhoto:CameraSerialNumber
></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
```

And there it is! :D

#### The Flag:
    flag{EEe_x_I_FFf}
