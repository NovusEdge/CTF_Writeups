### Problem Statement:
```txt
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.

It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

As stated by the challenge statement, the encryption is a Caesar cipher of some sort.
Now, to solve this, we may try the following approach:

First, we make a substitution table for the Caesar cipher.

Since we know, that the flag may be in the format: "flag{...}"
We can map out that:
	- u => f
	- a => l
	- p => a
	- v => g

Clearly, there's a shift of +15

The substitution table thus formed will be similar to:


----------------------------------------------------

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ 

l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d e f g h i j k

----------------------------------------------------

We can implement a script like `mono_shift_solution.py` to obtain the decrypted flag.
